PROBLEM 2:

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, 
return all root-to-leaf paths where the sum of the node 
values in the path equals targetSum. Each path should be 
returned as a list of the node values, not node references.

A root-to-leaf path is a path starting from the root and 
ending at any leaf node. A leaf is a node with no children.
